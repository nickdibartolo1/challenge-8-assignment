## Issues
I pretty much have finished the code for this project but when I run my index.js in my node terminal I get an issue that I can not seem to resolve. I went to office hours and could not get it solved. I also went to a tutor who helped solve some of it. The problem was originally that my inquirer was not working correctly even though I had it installed properly. My syntax was correct and this was confirmed by my tutor. He helped me solve the inquirer issue but it took up the whole tutor session. The problem I am having now is after I call the index in the node to run the program of prompting the user for the manager information, the program ends immediatly. The user gets to answer the manager questions at least but that is it. Im not sure what the problem is as I have my second function being called in my code ("createEmployee" function - for prompting the user about the employee information) but the program just ends. I am going to attatch a screen castify video of what I am experiencing.
